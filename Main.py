Description: The aim of this project is to apply Deep Learning techniques, to classify tree crown species from UAV
             images.
             The architectures under investigation are comprised of Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformer and
             Hybrid CNN-Transformer models. The dataset is comprised of UAV RGB and NDVI images depicting tree crowns of
             tree species from Wytham forest in Oxford.
             Moreover, conducting an investigation regarding Deep Learning Multimodal data fusion.
